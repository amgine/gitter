	/// flushed. If this variable is set to "0", the output of these commands will be done using completely buffered I/O.

	/// stderr telling about alias expansion, built-in command execution and external command execution. If this variable
	/// is set to an integer value greater than 1 and lower than 10 (strictly) then git will interpret this value as an
	/// open file descriptor and will try to write the trace messages into this file descriptor. Alternatively, if this
